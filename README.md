## Getting Started

Clone the app locally and in the root directory of the project, run:

npm run dev
```

The app should run on port 5173

## Features

- Users can create / read / edit / delete their own folders that are saved in the browser's local storage

## TODOS:

- Update UI? It's not the greatest but it's something ðŸ˜¶
- Switching different chips can be slow
- Implement chip sorting by:
  - Id - sort by chip id
  - ABCDE - sort by chip name
  - Code - sort by chip code
  - Damage - sort by chip damage
  - Element - sort by element - fire, water, elec, grass, null
  - MB - sort by megabyte size
